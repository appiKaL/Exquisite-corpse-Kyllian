### The story of the beaten child ###

## intro 

once there was a little child who had terrible parents 
he was constantly hited by his father and force to drink by his mother 
he was completly desesperated 



In a neglected corner of the bustling city, Alex, a ten-year-old boy, lived in constant fear within the walls of a decaying house. Each night, he bore the marks of his father's anger, praying silently for an escape. 

One evening, driven by a sudden surge of courage, Alex fled into the unknown streets, seeking a glimmer of hope and freedom. His journey had just begun, and for the first time, he felt the spark of a new beginning.

The beaten child was a psychopath 
So someone could say 
It was well deserved :D
